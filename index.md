Lately, I've been thinking about what makes me get out of bed in the morning.

Life is a gasp, and live a life in a heavy, drawn-out way, stuck with troubles and complains will get me nowhere. Know thyself, said an ond wise man.

Learn new things, overcome challenges, push my limits, share the journey with different people and cultures: that is what motivates me.

This space is an invitation to explore new learnings and insights. Ahh... using data, of course.
